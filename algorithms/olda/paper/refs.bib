  ABSTRACT = {
        We present the ALOI collection of 1,000 objects recorded under various
        imaging circumstances. In order to capture the sensory variation in
        object recordings, we systematically varied viewing angle, illumination
        angle, and illumination color for each object, and additionally
        captured wide-baseline stereo images. We recorded over a hundred images
        of each object, yielding a total of 110,250 images for the collection.
        These images are made publicly available for scientific research
        purposes.

Known algorithms for finding the MST are discussed. They are efficient even when there are very many points; this makes a SLCA practicable when other methods of cluster analysis are not. The relevant computing procedures are published in the Algorithm section of the same issue of Applied Statistics. The use of the MST in the interpretation of vector diagrams arising in multivariate analysis is illustrated by an example.},

     abstract = {High-density clusters are defined on a population with density f in r dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form {x | f(x) ≥ c}. Single-linkage clustering is evaluated for consistency in detecting such high-density clusters-other standard hierarchical techniques, such as average and complete linkage, are hopelessly inconsistent for these clusters. The asymptotic consistency of single linkage closely depends on the percolation problem of Broadbent and Hammersley-if small spheres are removed at random from a solid, at which density of spheres will water begin to flow through the solid? If there is a single critical density such that no flow takes place below a certain density, and flow occurs through a single connected set above that density, then single linkage is consistent in separating high-density clusters (by disjoint single-linkage clusters that include a positive fraction of sample points in the respective clusters and pass arbitrarily close to all points in the respective clusters). The existence of a single critical point remains a conjecture. A weaker result is proved that shows that single-linkage clusters detect high-density clusters if there is a low enough valley separating them.},

This article proposes several criteria which isolate specific aspects of the performance of a method, such as its retrieval of inherent structure, its sensitivity to resampling and the stability of its results in the light of new data. These criteria depend on a measure of similarity between two different clusterings of the same set of data; the measure essentially considers how each pair of data points is assigned in each clustering.},

In particular, we examine two of the main assumptions of the process of forming MFCCs: the use of the Mel frequency scale to model the spectra; and the use of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to decorrelate the Mel-spectral vectors. We examine the first assumption in the context of speech/music discrimination. Our results show that the use of the Mel scale for modeling music is at least not harmful for this problem, although further experimentation is needed to verify that this is the optimal scale in the general case. We investigate the second assumption by examining the basis vectors of the theoretically optimal transform to decorrelate music and speech spectral vectors. Our results demonstrate that the use of the DCT to decorrelate vectors is appropriate for both speech and music spectra.},

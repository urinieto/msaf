SIPLCA Music Analysis
=====================

This package contains the implementation of the algorithm for
identifying repeated harmonic patterns in music and structure
segmentation described in [1].  It is primarily written in Python but
calls Matlab for feature extraction and performance evaluation.

It depends on NumPy and SciPy (http://www.scipy.org/), Matplotlib
(http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) for plotting, and the mlabwrap
package (http://mlabwrap.sourceforge.net/) for running Matlab code.

Included is Dan Ellis' beat-synchronous chroma feature extraction
code, also available from:
http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/projects/coversongs/

Also useful (but not included) is Dan's code for resynthesizing
chroma:
http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/matlab/chroma-ansyn/

All code in this package is distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License.  See the file COPYING for details.


Example usage
-------------

From the command line
`````````````````````
segmenter.py can be run as a script to run the structure segmentation
algorithm on a single audio file.  The usage is as follows:

segmenter.py -i inputfile.wav -o outputfile [-param1 val1] [-param2 val2] ...

Where parameters "-param1", etc. are optional and are defined in the
docstring for segmenter.segment_song.
    
For MIREX 2010, please run the shell script runme_mirex2010.sh as follows:
runme_mirex2010.sh inputfile.wav outputfile


From Python
`````````
>>> import segmenter
>>> wavfile = '/path/to/come_together.wav'
>>> rank = 4  # rank corresponds to the number of segments
>>> win = 60  # win controls the length of each chroma pattern
>>> niter = 200  # number of iterations to perform
>>> np.random.seed(123)  # Make this reproduceable
>>> labels = segmenter.segment_wavfile(wavfile, win=win, rank=rank,
...                                    niter=niter, plotiter=10)

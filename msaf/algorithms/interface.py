class SegmenterInterface:
    """This class is an interface for all the segmenter algorithms included
    in MSAF. These segmenters must inherit from it and implement one of the
    following methods:
            processFlat()
            processHierarchical()

    Additionally, two private helper functions are provided:
        - preprocess
        - postprocess

    These are meant to do common tasks for all the segmenters and they
    should be called inside the process method if needed.

    All segmenters must return estimates times for the boundaries (est_times),
    and estimated labels (est_labels), **even if they can't compute them**.

    The following three types of algorithms with their behaviors are:
        - Computes boundaries and labels:
            If in_bound_times is None:
                Compute the est_times
            Else:
                Do not compute est_times, simply use in_bound_times instead
            If in_labels is None:
                Compute the est_labels
            Else:
                Do not compute est_labels, simply use in_labels instead

        - Computes boundaries only:
            Compute boundaries and return est_labels as None.

        - Computes labels only:
            Use in_bound_times in order to compute the labels.
            Return est_times as in_bound_times and the computed labels.

    In these cases, est_times or est_labels will be empty (None).
